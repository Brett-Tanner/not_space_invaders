# Definitely not space invaders

My first attempt at writing something in python, a game built with pygame focused on repelling interlopers from the astral plane with a laser.

## How it works

The player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen which can be moved left and right with the arrow keys, and fire its laser when the space bar is pressed.

When the game begins a fleet of aliens begins to descend from the top of the screen while moving side to side. If any of these aliens reach the player or the bottom of the screen, the player loses one of their 3 lives. If the player destroys a fleet of aliens a new, faster fleet will spawn.

## Ideas for an ESL version

- The enemy 'ships' are words, you 'shoot' each letter by typing the word
- Add a menu screen where you can select a set of vocab
